Alex says hi

Hi there,

You've probably better things to do than browse my github repositories ;-)

Still, if you're interested: I am Alexandra, a Dutch gal living in Germany. I work as a technical writer and I have been blogging about the differences between the German and Dutch language and culture since 2009. You can find me on buurtaal.de (posts in German)
