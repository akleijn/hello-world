Alex' test repository

Hi world,

You've probably better things to do than browse my github repositories ;-)

Still, if you're interested: I am Alexandra, a Dutch gal living in Germany. I work as a freelance translator and a language teacher (for Dutch). I love WordPress and have been blogging about the differences between the German and Dutch language and culture since 2009.
